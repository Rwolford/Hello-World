# Hello-World
This is my first Repository! Yay!

Introduction:

My name is River Wolford. I am 22 years old at time of writing, and am a few months into the journey of learning Web Development. I am currently learning how to use GitHub (duh) and I know some basic HTML/CSS. I am learning the finer points of Bootstrap and I am using FreeCodeCamp.com, Udacity.com, and other resources for training. My goal is to learn this myself, then start working freelance before applying to work full time with an actual company.
